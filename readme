The program 'extensify' determines the extension of all files in the
current working directory and adds the extension to it.  It makes an
assumption that if a '.' exist in a file name it already has an
extension and thus does not add extension.  'Extensify' is provided
with no warranty or anything.

I wrote this script for a friend
[http://www.flickr.com/photos/awsomangelo], he is a photographer too
and he had recovered several files from his hard disk. He had around
8000 files recovered which didn't have extensions. And in GNU/Linux
box to open a file with a specific application you don't require
extension, but "Windows" depends on the extension. So he wanted a
mechanism to add extensions to it. This little program makes a guess
based on the "mimetype", and then determines its extension.

Handy little tool if you have several files for which you want to add
the file extension.
